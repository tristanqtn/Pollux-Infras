# Pollux Test Infras

This directory contains everything to deploy Pollux testing environment based on Raspberry PIs, VMs or physical servers and machines.


## Test environment


### Raspberry PIs

Raspberry PIs are a great way to test in a personal or low-cost environment.
The latest generations of Raspberry PI (4,5) can be used to simulate working environments under acceptable conditions.

### VMs

VMs are also a good low-cost way of testing Pollux's deployment and various scripts. They facilitate network management between different servers or machines.

### Physical servers and machines

Physical servers and machines are much more expensive, and therefore depend on the infrastructure you have available. Nevertheless, they enable testing under conditions that are as close as possible to the reality of a company's infrastructure.

## Different test configurations offered by Pollux

As part of our project, we decided to create different scenarios to simulate multiple types of business and infrastructure.
